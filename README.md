Hello there👋🏻,

My name is James Weiss, and I love data in the dorkiest way possible. 

This GIT contains a combination of some passion projects, older scripts that I had permission to post from consulting, and some miscellanous scripts that don't belong anywhere else.

Feel free to have a look around, and let me know what you think! You can add me on LinkedIn if you wish to connect or ask any questions, the link can be found below.

Stay curious.
